<h2><b>Hi, I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹</b></h2>

<p>I love creating minimalist, modern, and cohesive experiences, and enjoy experimenting with new and innovative technology. My interest in how things work has driven me into building a range of digital tech; including full-stack websites, software applications, and machine learning implementations.</p>

<p>I believe that innovation can only truly happen when technology is developed and maintained by a multitude of diverse people, and I therefore strive to partake in and support open-source wherever I can.</p>
