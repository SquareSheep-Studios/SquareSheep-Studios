# Hi, I'm [Dan](https://www.dansmith.tech)

I love creating minimalist, modern, and cohesive experiences, and enjoy experimenting with new and innovative technology. My interest in how things work has driven me into building a range of digital tech; including full-stack websites, software applications, and machine learning implementations.

I believe that innovation can only truly happen when technology is developed and maintained by a multitude of diverse people, and I therefore strive to partake in and support open-source wherever I can.
